# Duke it Out

A web chat app that allows fans on rival sports teams to argue in a fun way. Created for nwHacks 2019. Built with React, Redux, Node, Express, SocketIO and MySQL. Deployed on Microsoft Azure until the end of April 2019 (http://duke-it-out.azurewebsites.net/).

## Project Details
* User is able to sign up for an account, and login and logout.
* The main page allows users to browse through available chat rooms.
* Once the user is in a chat, they are able to see messages.
* If the user is logged in, they have the option to join a team within their chat.
* Once the user joins a team, their team appears on the left side of the screen and they can send messages for their team
* Conversely, the opposite team appears on the right side of the screen.
